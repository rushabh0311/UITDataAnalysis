# UITDataAnalysis
UITDataAnalysis is a Python-based data analysis project developed during my internship at Brose India Automotive Systems Pvt. Ltd. The goal of the project was to analyze and visualize sensor data from automotive systems to extract meaningful insights and assist in performance evaluation and fault detection.
